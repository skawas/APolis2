#aPolis
A tool for vulnerable populations to connect with neighborhoods that have strong community support potential. Subsequent iterations will evolve from a focus on vulnerable populations to other population profiles as well.

## HackHousing Project aPolis screenshots:

1.	Vulnerable Population Personal Need Profiler (9 dimensions, 4-6 profiles) 
2.	HeatMap of Community Support Potential
3.	Community Potential Recommender 

## The Challenge:

This project explores how can we indicate based on open data that a neighborhood has a thriving community.  We build on a long history of research showing that thriving communities are more likely to grow when there are “third places” in a centralized location, where people are more likely to serendipitously interact.   By quantifying the number of third places in a neighborhood and their “hubbiness”, we can indirectly measure community.  Third places include:  bars, coffee shops, community centers, and so forth.

##### o	What are the users priorities for community and what community potential most fits their household’s needs (public and social support, job, transit, safety, health services & budget) better than where they live today?
o	Leading To: link to most appropriate search tools for home/funding/transit/jobs etc.

## Contributing

###Innovation (25%): How original is this aPolis vs other products and platforms? 

Missing in existing neighborhood rating/ranking tools are search capabilities for assessing community vitality, social interactivity, social capitol, or local networking. Existing neighborhood profile sites aggregate consumption services (FourSquare, Yelp), public services (transit, schools, hospitals) and consumption goods (grocery, coffee). Our target populations tend to be lower income. They benefit from finding places in which to search for housing with healthy informal economies, versus, conventional economies.

###Usefulness (30%): How effectively does the product solve the stated problem?

Conventional research of community potential takes months, weeks or days. aPolis shrinks the time to seconds.

###Impact (25%): What is potential of product to have immediate local impact?

The tool has a lot of potential for positive impact by helping people become empowered through their membership in thriving communities.

###Functionality (20%): 

Working functionality of the product as submitted and potential for submission to be completed through to launch (this will take into account demonstrated technical capabilities)

##Apolis Appendix

Living in a thriving community can be  an important component of personal/family well-being.  A thriving community is one where 
a) people know and regularly interact with each other, 
b) members have a sense of belonging that motivates them to help each other & the community,  
c) members are able to articulate their common goals, and 
d) members can work together to achieve those common goals.

When people are looking for places to live, what they lack in income, they can make up for by finding places with thriving communities.

Target user:
Low income or others experience life challenges warranting the need for more social support.
